//Discription:

//Waht is happining here, first we defien an arrow func,

//in seconde line we difene an arrow func,that takes 3 inputs

//two string and last one as call back is a func,

//we difine a fuul name two fname and lname

//and then we call callback func, to show full name,

//then we give some input by hand and we call our main func,

//callback func is func to used for passing func to eachother,but there is problem,

//if the amount of func is increased we will have callbackhell,

//and surely we can not undderstand what is happening

//then in ECs6 promises release that is like callback func asyuncronse, and it prevents of callback hell,
