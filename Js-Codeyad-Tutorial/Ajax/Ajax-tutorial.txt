Hello Ajax !!!

<-------------------->

U are working on Ajax.

<-------------------->

http: hyper text transfer protocol, its a browser protocol and structer that helps u to connect between from ur device (client) to sever. 

How connection will happen? => whenever u click on url or go to any website a REQUEST will be sumbmited to server, that sever will check then RESPONE.

Response => inludes some info head & body(html,json,xml,...),

What json & Xml are? => some frames that Raw Data will transfer inside of them. (***Json***)

REQUEST => Data of device, *** Type of REQUEST *** , lang,...

Type of Request:

1-GET: When u want to recive infos from server,

2-Post: When u want to post some info into server. 

3-Put: When u Want  to convert some info in the server,

4-Delete: when u want to remove info inside of the server.

whenever u send of these type of Request to server it will  check & respone some info,

type of server  and version and status are the most imp info in response,

if stsatus is in range of 200 is succesfull,for more info google it.

if status is in range of 400 is problem from client,

<-------------------->

.Ajax:

There is an object, will aplly Respone & request without need to reload ur page

object is xmlHttpRequest, via this object u can use Ajax on ur client without relaod ur page 

ex;xhi.open("GET", "Ajax/Ajax-tutorial.txt", true); 

here first we must open the object,by using open func

second we guding this func we mention first our type of request then, destinon, 

third

after that ,

xhi.onload = function () {
    if (xhi.status == 200) {
      txt.innerHTML = this.response;
    }
  };


we use another func name is on load, on loading process what is gonna happen,

we say if the status of our code is 200 return us the docs on Ajax-toturial file , this respone,

after that,

  xhi.send();

we send the our codes to ajax,
